Airbnb, Inc. is an online home sharing platform offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. 
It allows home owners and renters (hosts) to put their listings so that travellers can stay in them for payment.


Airbnb pricing is very important factor in cities like New York where there is huge competition. I would like to address 
the following problems:

Explore data to find key insights/trends in airbnb rental price which can help hosts to maximize earnings & allow guests to find the perfect airbnb based on neighbourhood.
Leverage machine learning to predict the price for properties in New York.
